<p>User accounts are organized in groups - and each user has at least one group, his &quot;personal group&quot;. A group may be associated with ACLs, forming an ACL-entry.</p>
<p>There are three special groups which have to be present in a Cinnamon repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>_everyone</em> Every user is automatically a member of this group. You can create ACL-entries with this group to grant certain rights to all users.</p></li>
<li><p><em>_owner</em> During permission validation a user is considered to be a member of the owner group, if he is the owner of this object. This way you can deny write-permission to all users but grant it to the owner of an object. Note: the creator of an object is also its owner.</p></li>
<li><p><em>_superuser</em> The members of this group are not limited by permissions or ACLs in any way - they simply are not subject to permission checks. Do not add users to this group because it's the easy thing to do. Rather, you may create a more permissive default ACL, if you really wish to avoid a proper rights management.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The special groups are computed automatically, it is not recommended to add real user accounts to these groups.</li>
<li>Do not delete a user's personal group.</li>
<li>Do not rename a user's personal group.</li>
<li>Although it is possible to assign a group to another (and create group hierarchies in this way), it is better to not create unnecessarily complex inheritance hierarchies to which a user's group is directly added. So, instead of having all editors inherit the group &quot;editors&quot;, you should make them members of the group &quot;editors&quot;. This makes it easier for example if you have to transfer one user from &quot;editors&quot; to &quot;reviewers&quot; - or if he has to be in both groups at once.</li>
</ul>
